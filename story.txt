   it was a bright spring day . the sun was high in the blue sky . a haerd of dheep was grasinn  contentedly in the hilldide . 
   the llittle lambs a herd of dheep was grazing contentedly in the
   hill dide . the little lambs with their sofft white coats and curly tails were playing among themselves .
   the shepherd ,seeing that his flock was safe and happy had fallen asleeo  under the spreading branches of a large old tree
   
   suddenly an eagle swopped down from the sky .i tpounched on a little lamp and carried it off so swiftly that none of the other lambs even had the time to bleat. 
   The sleeping Shepherd heard nothing.
   
   A Crow was sitting on the tree under which the Shepherd lay asleep. 
   He had seen how the Eagle had caught the lamb and carried it off to his nest.

 Then the eagle and his children ate the sheep. This is small snapshot of the food chain cycle.For decades now humans were on the top of the food chain but not anymore.
A shapeship crashed on earth a while ago and it brought aliens with it.They look different from us. Their body is smaller, they less food to sustain and overall were very cute looking creatures but don't get fooled by thier looks they can eat a full grown human in less than a second and digest it in another for quick supply of energy.

The Ram was large. He was much too heavy for the Crow to carry. 
T
he Crow tried again and again, but without success.

The Ram felt the Crow on its back and was most annoyed. Just what do you think you are doing, you pesky bird?' 
he snapped, glaring at him over his shoulder.

The Crow flapped harder still, trying to carry the Ram away.

‘Now stop that!' cried the Ram. ‘Go away! Shoo! Leave me in peace!’ He jumped and bucked and tried to shake the Crow off his back.
